#  Disease Prediction & Handwritten Prescription OCR Web App

Welcome to your smart medical assistant! This web application is designed to help users:

  Predict possible diseases by simply entering their symptoms.

  Upload handwritten medical prescriptions and get the content digitized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

Itâ€™s built with simplicity in mind â€” whether youâ€™re a doctor digitizing notes or a patient trying to understand symptoms or prescriptions.

##  What It Can Do

###  Predict Diseases from Symptoms
- Users can enter symptoms such as `fever, cough, headache` into a text box.
- Upon clicking the **Predict** button, the system suggests a probable disease using a trained machine learning model.

### Understand Handwritten Prescriptions
- Users can upload a scanned or photographed handwritten prescription.
- The system extracts readable medical content (like medication names and dosage) using OCR.
- This helps digitize and interpret handwritten doctor notes.

##  How it Works

### 1. Disease Prediction Flow
- User enters symptoms like: `itching, vomiting, fatigue`.
- The input is preprocessed and passed to the trained ML model.
- Output: Predicted disease (e.g., **Jaundice**).

### 2. Handwritten Prescription OCR Flow
- User uploads a handwritten prescription image.
- The app uses `pytesseract` to extract text from the image.
- Output: Extracted medical instructions (e.g., `paracetamol 500mg, twice a day`).
